                Every full moon night, from the calm quiet sea comes a desolate sob. It was said the cries would bring misfortune so the residents living near the sea lived in fear. But one day, a passing noble who heard this tale vowed to make the little mermaid smile again.

Content Warning: Certain Stalking Behaviour

Season: Summer

(Hmm hmm~ Hmm♪ At long last I’m able to browse the idol merch store~!)
(With the wall fully covered by idols’ pictures and flyers, and the songs of different groups entering your ears…… It feels like I’m surrounded by my favourite idols, it’s so Love-ly☆)
(For the me that had a super exhausting day at practice, this is basically the best feast to regain energy♪)
(Let me think, what should I buy today…… I didn’t get that badge last time, should I go and pick it out again?)
(Even though I brought enough money to buy a whole box this time, but to gather a whole lot of dupes just for one, it feels like it isn’t worth it.)
(Not to mention if I happen to get the badge after just buying one pack, then I’ll have quite some money remaining for other merch.)
(The shop&#39;s marketing tactics definitely appeal to the consumer’s gambling mentality. Huhu, what a trap~……)
(Wait a sec, that 「Eden」poster over there, it seems like it’s my first time seeing it…… Could it be newly arrived merch?)
(Then I better hurry. After all, 「Eden」merch always sells super fast, that even if you go online to buy it second-hand, the prices always skyrocket.)
(…… Oh, I remember! A few days ago during a tea party for a 「Pretty5」meeting, Tomoe-senpai seemed to have mentioned「Eden」would be releasing a new CD soon.)
(Turns out this time they would have a live handshake event for fans who bought the CD…… If I miss this rare chance, I’ll definitely regret it forever!)
(Ahaha, it seems even the employees are shocked at the amount of CDs I’m buying, and kindly layered the shopping bags too.)
(Huu(groaning), this month’s allowance is going to vanish in the blink of an eye, I told myself that I’ll have to save money on food and expenses a bit……)
(Having so many CDs, at least it’ll buy me some time during the handshake event, won’t it? I’m really looking forward to what Tomoe-senpai will say, ehehehe……♪)

Jun-kun, you walk too slowly! If you don’t want to be left behind, hurry up and come!

(……Huh? Just now I seemed to have really heard Tomoe-senpai’s voice? Or am I still deep inside the world of fantasy?)


GODDAMN! Isn’t it because Ohii-san tossed all your messy bags to me to carry, on the other hand you’re free to roam?

Haha, hasn’t that always been Jun-kun’s job? It&#39;s too late to feel dissatisfied now!

(Let me pinch myself…… Uwoah, it hurts!)
(Wait what, this really is the real world and in front of me are living 3D idols?! Wahhhh, my mind is going blank!)
(——Ah, the two senpai-s went towards the escalator. I better hurry up and catch up, and tread lightly……☆)
(Even though sneaking behind the senpai-s’ back comes off as quite rude, i have to ignore that for now!)
(Being able to see 「Eve」, the two elite idols’ everyday shopping, it really is too Love~ly! I might miss it if I blink!)
(That&#39;s why, please allow me to enjoy this sacred sight for a bit, to create an unforgettable memory……)

Hmm, this clothing store looks fine! Jun-kun don&#39;t just sit there slacking off, hurry and accompany me~♪

What is it, can’t you let me rest for a bit…… Unlike Ohii-san, I’m not fatigue-less during shopping.
When we left home didn’t we say today is only for buying sunscreen products? Clothing shops are undeniably not according to plan.

I’ve already said change of plans, haven’t I? If life only moves forward while following a prescribed path, that’d be way too boring.

That sentence shouldn’t be used here…… Well never mind, Ohii-san always goes way off-schedule, and I&#39;ll only be able to follow you to the end.

Mmhmmh! Having spent days working with Jun-kun, I can finally welcome the rare days of rest, looking forward to it all from now on♪
Talking about summer, we’ll surely need to go to the beach and fully embrace the radiant sunshine and soft sandy beach! So I definitely need to restock my sunscreen and summer outfits!

……Just asking, but what’s the necessary cause and effect between those two sentences?
Oh and also, since we entered this shop, it seems like there’s this fiery gaze that is pinned to our backs…… I can’t be wrong, right?

Hmmhmm, my existence is someone who always catches the eye, that’s why this is inevitable!
Since Jun-kun is always by my side, surely you’ve gotten used to it by now?

Sigh~ Is it alright to be so relaxed? Or is it that Ohii-san feels that even if we run into any suspicious person, I’ll be your shield?

That idea isn’t so bad, thank you for reminding me☆
To put it simply, don’t mind it, and focus instead on enjoying the process of shopping, that’s good weather/ii-hiyori!!
Come look come look, this t-shirt with a pattern of big red flowers, doesn’t it have the spirit of summer? ♪
But I fancy the coconut tree pattern mor-
(……Hm? There’s another hand that’s faster than me by a second, grabbing a shirt of the same style?)

Hey excuse me, could I pay~♪
(But the merch I’ve already bought is so heavy to carry, even if I wanted to buy more, I’d most likely struggle to bring it back.)


Location: Shopping centre first floor

Location: Beach


♪～♪～
Stepping barefoot on the soft sand feels great! Coupled with the refreshing sea breeze, it’s such good weather/ii hiyori……♪

Haha, Ohii-san looks like a little child running amok. Be careful to not step on crabs and whatnot~?
……Wah!? Why’d you splash water at me!

Hmph. Since Jun-kun says I’m a little child then playing like this is normal isn’t it?

GODDAMN…… Take a hint, Ohii-san!

I’m hiding~ Yuzuru-kun, careful☆

............?

Ah?! Crap, I already splashed the water at-!
So- Sorry, I didn’t mean to splash it on you, Fushimi.

Ah, it’s alright, only the corner of my T-shirt got wet, please don’t mind it.
Actually it was me who was distracted, if not this would have been easily avoided.

So it’s like that Yuzuru-kun, does looking at such beautiful scenery lift your spirits？

Yes indeed, I noticed there are booths that are selling the fresh local produce too. As expected of a holiday resort, how plentiful♪

Hm? Yuzuru-kun’s observation skills are particularly exceptional.

I was thinking that, in such hot weather, body moisture would quickly evaporate. Young master would definitely feel thirsty after work.
That’s why if your esteemed selves wouldn’t mind, please allow me to go to the booths and pick out ingredients to prepare some drinks and salad.

……You want to take charge even here? Why not go to the cold drinks stall and buy ready-made drinks?
Just in good time, I happen to be thirsty now so why don&#39;t we let Jun-kun buy it for us?

Hah~? Can’t you see the long queue of people in front of the cold drinks stall? By the time my turn comes, I’ll practically be sunburnt all over?

Please don’t fret over this. Even if the need arises to run around, leave it to me to wait on your esteemed selves.
But in just a glance, one can tell that those types of drinks add a lot of artificial colouring and flavours, and even if the young master may like it, it doesn’t have enough nutritional value.
Besides, I also feel that it is within my powers to create a handmade gift to thank the young master for his hard work.
At this very moment, this is what I want to do the most.

Hmm…… If Yuzuru-kun is happy to do so, then I don’t have anything to say. But if you do that, we can’t call it a good rest, right?

It’s nothing. If you actually let me rest and not do anything else, the accumulated stress would be far too much.
Hiyori：Ahaha, it sounds like Yuzuru-kun has some kind of strange inclinations♪
Then all the best to you, if you have anything you want, let Jun-kun help out! See you later~

Hey hey, don’t go running around…… If you get lost, I won’t be responsible for finding you~?

A few minutes later


Fushimi, I brought the fruit stall’s juicer.

Ahh… This would really help a lot, thank you so much.

No no, it’s only a simple gesture, rather you shouldn’t treat me so courteously.
What’s more, because Ohii-san brought so much luggage I troubled you to help hold a part of it, so let this be in return for your kindness.
If you have anything else I could do, just ask.

Haha. If you let someone like me, who is used to waiting on others, suddenly instruct, won’t it feel sort of strange.
But considering that, could you please help rinse the fruits and vegetables over here, and leave the rest to me.

For sure, no problem~
(Ahh, is this the true ability of the Himemiya house’s butler?)
(His knife work is way too skilled, and he’s swiftly cutting the fruit into small pieces so quick that it‘s difficult for the bare eye to keep up! I have to make the best use of the time to wash up! )

After a period of time


Huu…… Today’s work finally came to a close, and it went relatively well! Everyone, you have worked really hard~ (bows cutely)
(Huhu, now I’m hot and tired and thirsty, how I’d like to comfortably lie down in bed and have a cup of shaved ice.)
(First things first, I should go meet Yuzuru and the others…… )
(Ah, they&#39;re walking over just in time. Yuzuru seems to be holding something……?  )


Young Master, you’ve worked hard today♪

——Woah?!
That- What is that, the colour is so weird~!

Please calm down, this is not some weird object. This is the nutritional drink I created to congratulate young master with a feast, please try it out♪

……Even if you look at me with that gaze full of anticipation, I still don’t want to drink it! This totally looks like something you can’t even digest!


Hmm…… You can’t blame Tori-kun, I also feel that this drink is not at all 「Pretty」.

Oh, Ohii-san has returned. You’ve got a good grasp on time.
Just now you obviously didn’t help at all, so you can’t pick on someone else’s hardwork, can you?

Ahh, this is a misunderstanding as large as the heavens. I wasn’t slacking off, I went to get a present for Tori-kun!
Look here, these are the pink shells and sea snails I worked hard to find on the beach, don’t they fit Tori-kun?

Woah~! Each one of them is so cute! Thank you Hiyori-sama, I’ll keep it well♪

Hmmhmm, good boy good boy♪

……One can see that I arrived first to give the young master a gift, so why……

Ahaha, must we be particular about who comes first for this too?
But then Tori-kun, I think that you shouldn’t neglect the effort of Servant-kun. He must have spent quite a lot of thought for this glass.

I- I definitely know that! After all, Yuzuru could never want to harm me, right? Despite my worry, let me drink it!

Ahh, young master, thank you for the trust you have put in me……!

Eh, why are you thanking me! Isn’t this supposed to be the other way around?
(Anyways, it’s only a drink, I just need to hold my breath and drink it in one gulp!
Gulp gulp……


——? That’s weird, the taste is unlike what I thought it to be, it’s actually pretty nice?
Yuzuru, give me one more glass~!

Yes, it’s a delight to see young master enjoying it♪

Eh, is it that good? Then I would like to try and see!

Hmm, when drinking it, it is both sweet and refreshing. Actually, when I was looking at Yuzuru’s exquisite creation from the sidelines, I just knew that the taste would be pretty good.

Haha, you exaggerate. Actually during 「Niki’s Kitchen」I requested that Shiina-sama teach me a few ways to blend drinks and it seems like it turned out well, though I must tweak its appearance a little.
In order for young master would be happier eating my handmade nutritional meals, I must continue working harder to improve my cooking skills.

Season: Summer
Location: Shopping Centre - First Floor


……Ah, greetings, Hiyori-sama. To think we meet here.

Oh? If it isn’t the Himemiya family’s Servant-kun; Yuzuru-kun. Looks like your limbs are still pretty nimble, you almost scared me.

Haha, thank you for the compliment. I was hurrying to fulfill the young master’s orders, so I didn&#39;t notice you. My deepest apologies.

No, on the contrary, I&#39;m not complimenting you at all. You are the same person as always, only knowing how to be around your master for the whole day.


Yuzuru, are you still not done yet?
……Wah, it’s Hiyori-sama.

Long time no see, Tori-kun! If I had known you’ll also be shopping today, I would have come together with you!

Ehehe. Is Hiyori-sama inviting me on a date? I’m so happy♪
Just right, can Hiyori-sama help me pick out something casual to wear to the beach? I feel that this one is pretty good, that’s why I had Yuzuru take it for me♪

Beachwear? Is Tori-kun also preparing to go to the beach? Do you want to go together with Jun-kun and I?

Ahaha…… Even though I want to agree, unfortunately that isn’t it……

Yes. This time the young master is going to have a summer beach-themed personal photoshoot, and the site is a famous resort.
The start of the shoot is this weekend, and I will be following, that is why today I accompanied the young master to buy preparatory items.
Speaking of which, last year the young master had an advertisement job as the face of a soft drink manufacturer  company and it was received enthusiastically. That’s why these types of jobs keep arriving, one after the other.

Yes yes, I remember! The smile of Tori-kun blossoming towards the camera honestly has the power to make one’s heart flutter a beat.
Jun-kun and I will also be heading towards that beach during the weekend, so our travel plans will luckily overlap! Maybe we can even meet by the beach?

Ok ok! With Hiyori-sama by my side, I’ll become more motivated too☆

Then it’s set♪ But there’s still one more problem right in front of us (gestures at the the clothes)

……Eh? I got too distracted by Hiyori-sama’s exciting offer, but it seems like Hiyori-sama also likes this shirt?

After all, Tori-kun and I both like cute and trendy things, to have such a coincidence is not as if it’s unexplainable.
Thinking of it, if you were walking on the beach and suddenly got welcomed by a person dressed exactly like you…… Tori-kun wouldn’t feel happy, right?
But, if it’s Hiyori-sama, I wouldn&#39;t mind? That kind of scene would show that our relationship is very close♪
Ahh, then are you saying you want to wear a father-son outfit? Even more than me, would saying Tori-kun and Yuzuru wearing the same outfit be better?

No no, I don&#39;t want to match outfits with Yuzuru!?
But I believe, as idols, to put all our efforts into standing out would be best.

Even if we are all members of 「Pretty5」, your 「Pretty」and my 「Pretty」are not the same, right?

……Hm, I understand what Hiyori-sama means.
If it’s like that, who would suit this shirt more?

That’s of course the world’s most beautiful, most handsome and cutest ever idol—me!

I feel that Ohii-san can add two more “most”, the world’s most narcissistic, most capricious idol……♪

Hmph, does this conversation have any room for Jun-kun to butt in?
Besides, Hiyori-sama already reserved all of the “most”s, so don’t you mind giving me just this?
Really sorry but my principle is to hold on tight to my favourite things!
If Tori-kun wants it, then you’ll just have to try and snatch it away from me~☆

Eh~ There’s no need for stealing, because the world’s cutest idol has always been me☆

Wait wait, it’s obviously only picking clothes, how come it turned into a cuteness competition……?

Hmm hmm, cuteness competition sounds good! Why don’t we have a live vote! Hiyori VS Tori-kun☆

Ohii-san,  do you think I am the tsukkomi?
But I know Ohii-san has a lot of clothes that are immediately tossed into the closet without seeing much use, isn’t that a big waste of materials? That&#39;s why giving up on this one wouldn’t hurt.

Ugh, how can Jun-kun stab me in the back at the pivotal moment! I&#39;m so hurt!

Wow, does it mean your vote is for me? Of course Yuzuru would be on my side, so victory is already secured—

Actually, I believe that this shirt would not perfectly showcase the young master’s cuteness……
Hm, please forgive me for I cannot express these feelings clearly.

……Huh?! Why didn’t you say anything earlier, and even helped pick out that shirt to try on?

In the end, this is my personal opinion, which shouldn’t affect the young master’s decision.
What’s more, to satisfy a master’s wishes at all times is when a butler becomes complete……♪

Haha, looks like Tori-kun and I are at a stalemate, we need to find one more vote to decide this!


Hey, Aira-kun~ Come here quickly, I can see you♪
Oh, you really can see him reflected in the mirror! Shiratori, did you also come shopping?


……Ahaha, yes yes~ What a nice coincidence~?
(Huu, I accidentally revealed my position……)
(At times like this, the only thing to do is pretend it’s a coincidence. I don&#39;t want them to think I&#39;m a weirdo stalker~!)

To summarise, Tori-kun and I are having a cuteness competition right now, the winner will get to buy this shirt, that’s why we hope you’ll go according to your instinct and give your precious vote!

Huh?! Me, how can i have the right to critique the two senpai-s!
In my eyes, the two senpai-s are celestially cute! To let me select gold and silver is not even a matter of choice, it’s an inquiry of the soul!
……But wait a sec. Shiratori, stand still.
(Hm? Hm? Why are the two senpai-s not speaking and only scanning me up and down without blinking?)
It shouldn’t be that they found out I was following them all along?! huu, i want to burrow into a hole……! )

Hmm…… It would feel a little awkward.

Haha, I’m kidding♪ Although it’s only natural for a dazzling person like me to have gained Tori-kun’s admiration.


Ahaha♪ Because Hiyori-sama is a person I respect, I’m fine with all the other titles being carried by you, but having the title of ‘cutest ever idol’ isn’t quite right?
I don&#39;t have much aesthetic sensibility regarding「Pretty」, that’s why for me either choice doesn’t make a difference……
……? Did Hiyori-sama say Shiratori’s name? He’s also here?
(All because just now I was too entranced by watching the senpai-s, and couldn’t resist coming a bit closer, until I forgot to keep track of my surroundings.)
Apologies, this gave you this much stress? Actually this is only a lighthearted battle of wills between me and Hiyori-sama, you don’t need to take it too seriously.

…………

Season: Summer
Location: Shopping centre first floor


Hm, even though I&#39;d rather not accept it, I’ll still give this shirt to you, Shiratori.

Yes yes, Tori-kun and I are on the same wavelength!

Ehh? What is this? I can’t for the life of me catch up with the two senpai-s’ trains of thought~

To be honest, one look and you can see why. This shirt suits you the best, that’s why Tori-kun and I both willingly withdrew from the competition.

Yes! Shiratori, it’s hard to come by such fitting clothing, you better not miss out on this opportunity!

That, that…… Thank you so much for your enthusiastic recommendation, but I didn&#39;t come here to buy clothes.
Although it’s quite embarrassing to admit, I’ve already spent all that I have, so……

So that’s the case. It’s alright, I&#39;ll just need to buy it for you, don’t i?

I see, how sly of Tori-kun to use this opportunity to try to increase your favourability in Aira-kun’s eyes, how sly~
Jun-kun, Jun-kun, hurry and have the shop clerk pick out a size that fits Aira-kun, and wrap it up!

Sigh~! How can Hiyori-sama snatch away this one too? At least let me carry half of the bill?

Haha, then let’s do it like that. Well then, Aira-kun, you can’t reject us now♪

……Woah?! Is this the power of the rich?! The- Then I&#39;ll accept it with gratitude in my heart!
Uwoah, this is a present given by an idol! Once I return home, I&#39;ll definitely wash it well and designate it as a family heirloom!

Haha, isn’t your reaction too exaggerated? And doing so would defeat the purpose of buying it.

I say I say, Aira-kun, wear it the next time we meet and let us see! Undoubtedly it’ll be super cute!
Oh and I&#39;ve been really curious since earlier, the bags Aira-kun are holding seems to be stuffed full, what exactly did you buy?

Ehehe, this will remain a temporary secret. Wait for a while and Tomoe-senpai will naturally come to know~

…………?

I still have some things to do after this, so I&#39;ll leave first! To have met the senpai-s, it makes today so so happy!
Oh and I hope that the senpai-s will have a great time at the beach!

Well then, bye bye~
……Eh, did we tell Shiratori we are going to the beach?

I don’t think so. Aira-kun is really a child bundled with mystery.

Location: Beach


A few days after

Good morning~ I&#39;m 「fine」’s Himemiya Tori. Please take care of me for today’s photoshoot~♪ (Cutely bows and greets)

(Hm…… So Tori-kun onset would be this kind of obedient and cute idol, thus swiftly conquering everyone’s hearts.)
So that even if he slips up, he will be forgiven by the doting crew. This child shouldn’t be underestimated.)

Ohii-san, what you’re thinking clearly shows on your face.
Sigh…… Even if Ohii-san is only pretending in front of people, if you restrained your capriciousness a bit it would get rid of a lot of my work-related stress.

Sorry but that’s unacceptable. The fans who’ve liked me since long before, they definitely do accept every part of me, right?
If I suddenly changed a part of me, my charisma would follow, diminishing.
And by Tori-kun’s side there’s the servant-kun who would follow him till death. Why can’t Jun-kun learn from that?


Were your esteemed selves talking about the young master just now?

……?!
Even though my heart is not as weak as eichi, it can’t handle repeated shock.
Gosh, it’s not like I’m guilty because I was bad mouthing Tori-kune. I hope that you won’t always appear out of deathly silence.

Apologies for my rude actions. Eichi-sama has also said that it’s a bad habit of mine, I&#39;ll do my best to change it.
Actually, I originally intended to put all my efforts into erasing my presence, and set up an umbrella for the young master at the rest area in advance.
As you can see, today’s sunlight is especially strong. To prevent sunburn during the process of shooting, we must prepare a strict prevention plan.
That’s why, young master please don’t take this opportunity to hide behind hiyori-sama, and obediently let me apply sunblock on your face.


I don&#39;t want it! Yuzuru, hand the sunblock over, let me do it by myself!

…… Young master, why are you suddenly vehemently rejecting it? When we left home in the morning, you were clearly still acquiescent.

Nnm, that’s because I woke up a bit late, so it would have been faster to let yuzuru help me.
But I dare not want others to think that I’m a helpless child! I’ll definitely be made fun of by the crew members!
And again, it’s only applying sunblock, which is very simple!
First, use a wet towel to wipe clean the sweat and oil on your face, then spray a layer of a mist spray……
After that, squeeze sunblock onto the palm of your hand and use the tip of your finger to spread it evenly across your face, followed by gently dabbing and applying onto your face……
Hmm hmm, how is this? Didn’t I do it well~?

Ahaha. Even though the steps are correct, tori-kun didn’t apply the sunblock evenly.
Just let me help you? Let me do it, let me do it……☆

——Woah!?
……Hiyori-sama’s fingertips are pretty cold, it feels so nice~
Ehehe. If Hiyori-sama and Eichi-sama are both so kind, I can’t help but want to be spoiled♪

Eh~ Why do you have to suddenly spoil the mood by mentioning Eichi-kun, it’s now totally destroyed.

……Hiyori-sama, thank you for helping the young master apply sunblock.

Ahh. Even though Yuzuru-kun has a smile on his face, I have a feeling he’s not happy at all.
Actually you’re probably blaming me for snatching away your job right?

……
No, I’m blaming myself.
Obviously the young master wanting to be independent is a good thing, but I can never seem to completely let go of his hand, to the point of this inability to adapt leading me to feel disappointed over such changes.
And I remember what happened last year too, once the young master reached the beach he immediately started complaining about how the weather was too hot, the sunrays were too harsh, and made me do this and tha—

Hey hey hey, why do you need to bring up my dark past, just because you’re reflecting on yourself!
……My whole life, Yuzuru has already spent so much time tending to me, so I hope yuzuru will think of yourself more from now on.
And for now, after all the trouble coming to the beach, do go together with Hiyori-sama and Jun and rest well.
Ah, the crew members over there are calling me over. I’ll leave Yuzuru in your hands!

Yes yes, Tori-kun, rest assured and go to work! Jun-kun and I will bring Yuzuru-kun to the nearby beach and guarantee he thoroughly forgets his worries and relaxes!

……Haha, then I&#39;ll humbly accept this precious opportunity. And please, do not drag me along.


(Ohii-san is sticking his nose in other people’s business again…… but it can’t be helped, he’s this sort of person.)

Location: Beach

Time: That night


Always at night a ghost appears, the idol instructor 「Monster」……Does ES really have this sort of ghost stories?

Yes, it even is considered a popular rumour. Because it happened in Yumenosaki Academy, I heard it’s one of the「Seven Mysteries」.

「Seven Mysteries」? And what are the others?

Let me think…… The will-o-wisp loitering about the garden terrace, the Bach portrait whose hair grows longer every time you see it……
But the one that’s most famous should be the piano music that comes from the empty music room?

Haha, hearing about it is so entertaining! As expected, summer nights are perfect for ghost stories!
Talking about that, Tori-kun tonight is especially quiet. You don’t like the atmosphere?

……Wuwu (sobbing noises), I completely can’t see how any of these stories are entertaining, it feels like I won’t sleep at all tonight.

Come come, poor little princess, if you’re scared come I’ll cradle you to my bosom♪

Wh- Who says I’m scared! It must be because the night has a lower temperature so I feel chilly……

Then let I go to the lodgings and assist the young master in bringing a jacket, it’ll be a hassle if you really do catch a cold.
Hm? Why are you suddenly grabbing onto the edge of my shirt?

I’m not actually cold! So don’t go anywhere, and only stay by my side!

……Haha, as you wish, I understand.

Talking about that, when I was picking shells in the

Mermaids…… That’s a kind of sea creature that only lives in humans’ imagination.

But at the same time no one can ascertain that mermaids don’t live in this world, right?
Well basically, the tale goes like this——


「Every full moon night, from the calm quiet sea comes a desolate sob. That is the mermaid’s recounting of its resentment. 」
「Her folk had previously been tricked by the humans on land, eventually becoming sea foam.」

Oh, hearing it isn’t that the follow-up of the fairytale「The Little Mermaid」.

「Those who hear the weeping, if they do not possess a strong will, will get bewitched, and step by step, gravitate towards the ocean, until they get swallowed by the waves 」


Wuwu……(crying noises)Wuwuwu……

……Hm? Tori-kun, can it be that you’re so frightened that you’re crying?

How can that be! Bu- But I also seem to have heard it……?

Wu……Huaahh……

There really is someone crying, what’s more it seems to be far away……

Ahh. Everyone please raise your heads. Tonight the night sky is clear and one can clearly see a bright and clear full moon.

Wait a sec, a full moon night…… And an unknown crying voice……


Th- That’s pretty scary! I don’t want to be led into the sea by mermaids?!

Young master, please calm down a bit. That type of story is usually fiction, but through word of mouth, it became more embellished that’s all.
Above all, you still have me by your side. At any moment, I absolutely won’t let you get a scratch on your body.

Wait a minute, if indeed this patch of coastal area really has mermaids, then it would surely be frightening! Do you want to follow the sound and find out?
This is a one in a thousand chance, maybe we can even accept interviews as a record holder, and appear on the front page news!

The headline would be something like 「Shocking news! A famous ES idol found a mermaid when on vacation by the beach, what is its true identity?!」

Yes yes, hearing it sounds very sensational, this is good weather/ii hiyori! Then let’s hurry and assemble a search team to explore!


…………

Apologies, the young master seems to have fainted till he does not have any reaction.

Ugh, it’s true. Then, Yuzuru-kun, stay here and accompany Tori-kun, and wait for our good news.
Jun-kun Jun-kun, hurry and come along, Let’s go!

Right right right……
(To be honest, I don’t really care whether or not mermaids exist.)
(If I had known earlier then I wouldn’t have mocked Ohii-san…… This reaction is like he’s roused his fighting spirit, and he won’t rest till he finds an answer. )


Now we’re close to the source of the sobbing, which is also coming closer to the truth of the case in point! Watson, what do you Jun: Hah? Is Ohii-san once again hooked on what random detective stories or dramas?
But that crying person’s shadow looks very small, and of course it doesn’t have any sort of mermaid’s tail…… It’s probably just a small It should be because at night there are many people strolling about the beach, and the child accidentally left their parents behind, that’s why they’re crying non-stop.
Eh, what a horribly boring deduction~? But I agree with you.
Let us keep moving ahead to uncover the mystery together, allowing this story to go full circle and arrive at a happy ending.
Hello, my little friend~ Are you searching for your Papa and Mama?
Don’t fear, don’t fear, this big brother here and I aren’t bad people, we’re in fact coming to help you aren’t we?

Sorry, but I still have to be the tsukkomi for a bit, what bad person would say they’re a bad person……
Well, Ohii-san, you stay by her here, don’t let her wander around.
Her parents should be searching for her too, so I’ll go and ask the pedestrians walking nearby, we should get good news quickly.

HmmMmm (sound of agreeing), then leave it to me! How reliable Jun-kun is at times like this!
There there, your papa and mama will be by your side in a flash, so please don’t cry?
See your cute little face is all wrinkled into a knot, let me wipe off your tears with this handkerchief. There there, good kid good kid.
I’m very sorry, I don’t have any snacks or toys onhand, but I can sing a very nice song.


♪～♪～♪
You ask what song is that? ……I don’t quite remember, maybe I heard it during my childhood.
I’m not sure why, but that tune just appeared in my mind.
……What is it? Do you feel better now?
That’s great♪ I also feel that this song is comforting, it has a kind of healing power.
Look, that big brother from earlier also brought your papa and mama back~ Hurry, go hug them tight and don’t ever let go.
Haha, that smile right now is very good! This is good weather/ii hiyori……♪

Location: Seisou Hall

Time: A few days after


Jun-kun, Jun-kun, I knew you were here playing games again!

……Hm? If it is the letter you’re holding in your hands, I’m guessing it should be a fan letter. Isn’t this a normal occurrence?

Mmmmm (sound of agreeing), you guessed half of it! This is not a normal fan letter, but a letter of thanks!

Letter of thanks……?

Do you still remember the time we were spending our holiday Afterwards her parents recognised that we were the idols from 「Eve」 that appeared on TV.On top of that, they now regret that they weren’t able to get an autograph!

So it’s like that. Truth be told, in such a situation, you wouldn’t care about other stuff.

And and, that child drew a picture for me, together with the letter of thanks!

What…… is this drawing? A fish that sings? Wearing some green unknown thing on its head?

Jun-kun’s eyesight is too weak,it’s obviously a beautiful mermaid!
Can’t you see the words written here, even though the strokes are all over the place? Just scrutinise it for a bit and you’ll recognise the characters.

Mer, maid, prin, cess, your, highness…… Yes, it suits Ohii-san♪

Hmph, logically speaking, shouldn&#39;t it be your highness the prince?
It must be because she heard Jun-kun call me 「Ohii-san」, and assumed it to be a homonym of 「Princess」. You’re all to blame!
But then, I fear I’m not like the fairytale’s mermaid princess, turning into seafoam at dawn and disappearing.
Because, I’m not anyone else but the world’s one and only idol—Tomoe Hiyori!
I will always stand on the sparkling stage, and help bring out everyone’s smile and love, to imprint my existence into everyone’s memory!
